                        I don’t really know how to begin this, so I suppose I’ll lay out my plan for the future of this project and why I’m starting it. About six months ago I had a girlfriend for a short time. Up until then, I had never confided in anyone about anything more than a surface level conversation topic. Don’t get me wrong, I have friends. Well, some friends. But I wasn’t emotionally available with them then, and I’m not with them now. However, for the most part I was okay with that. As you can probably expect, this changed when my girlfriend came into my life. Suddenly the veil of ignorance was ripped from my head and I learnt what it meant to share your aspirations, your frustrations, and well, your feelings, with someone else. So, when my then-girlfriend and I eventually broke up and she became my now-ex, I was left with a feeling of emptiness. Not just the emptiness that regularly follows a breakup, but one that came from a new feeling of isolation. This time my solitude came without the ignorance and the bliss. <br> <br>

Given I’m a rational human being, instead of forming new friendships or trying to strengthen old ones, I’ve decided to share my thoughts, ideas, and emotions with the internet (currently a google drive document but soon I’ll buy that domain!). Surely nothing of consequence will come from this. Because the internet is public, and I expect some of what I’ll talk about isn’t, I’ve decided to opt for my own anonymity, and while I might create a YouTube channel to explore my thoughts in a different medium, I won’t connect it to this project in any way for anonymity’s sake. So, before we really get into it, I’ll give some background on me (for anonymity’s sake). I’m a 19 year old who goes to college, who wants to pursue finance in the future, and who knows the truth about ritual lemming suicide. Also, I’ll note that I’ve never been able to keep a journal or diary or anything of the sort for all the times I’ve tried in the past, but in the most un-cliché sense possible, this time feels different. Maybe it's the medium or maybe it’s me, but something has changed. <br> <br>

One of the main reasons I’ve been inspired to start this project is from reading Paul Graham’s essays, which are posted on a blog that looks like it’s from 2004. It’s not. Graham writes about virtually any topic, but each essay is rooted in some type of actionable moral. My essays won’t be like that, at least to start. I’d rather my writing be more raw than force myself to try to output perfect pieces. I also don’t have the lucidity that comes after a long and prosperous career that Graham does. So for now, I want to just document my life so it can be looked back on by myself and others, regardless of my success or failure, to see where I went right or wrong. Sort of like a longitudinal study. I expect to grow as I write and for my writing to improve into something remotely discernible in the future, so if anyone is out there, in this corner of the internet, please stay a while. Please.
